About: 

"How to think like computer scientist, 3erd Edition" by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers, is an Excellent book wich gave me the first approach into Python programming with focus on Science. 

Espetially useful if you are a Scientist, an Engineer or you are related with the field of technology. The book uses a step by step teaching technicque with very good explanations and generally anticipating the contradictions that you might have when you go trought the book. 

All the files here are the excercises presented in the chapters of the book (except in the chapter 1, because here you work with the prompt).

- Files that begeins with "Cap":  Solution by me (all runs and works) of the excercises presented in the chapters of the book. 
Every individual excercise is marked with "#number" indicating the number of the excercise in the particular chapter. often because the script got too long the different excercises in a particular file are "commented" with three quotes """ so that they can run individually (you can pick any excercise and uncomment, but you will need to comment the other ones).

- The rest of the files without "Cap" in the begginin of the name are some additional files needed for some of the excercises, or they are the direct result of some of them, or are modules needed to excecute them.
